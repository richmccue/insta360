# Introduction to the 360 Camera 

- Pre-workshop activities: 20 min 
- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 50-70 min

## Why Insta 360? 

Before any UVic students, faculty, or staff with a valid UVic OneCard can borrow a 360 camera from the library, they need to successfully complete this workshop and pass the quiz at the end of this workshop with a 100% grade. We have made this workshop a prerequisite for borrowing our 360 cameras for two reasons:

       1. Our first 360 camera was damaged and is now unusable because of improper care of the dual camera lenses.
       2. Borrowers frequently have problems using basic 360 camera functionality and desirable.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Record video with the Insta360 on a tripod and selfie stick
2. Record still images with the Insta360 on a tripod and selfie stick
3. Transfer videos and images to a smartphone for editing
4. Edit video in the Insta360 iOS & Android software, including:
    - Trimming video Keyframes for orienting the default view for the 360 video
    - Select and track objects in the 360 video
    - Cover up tripod mount in Insta360 software
9. Learn how to protect the Insta360 lenses from being scratched, see what video from a scratched lens looks like, & know how much it costs to replace a scratched lens
